    "Ans:PROS:\n",
    "    SVM works relatively well when there is a clear margin of separation between classes.\n",
    "    SVM is more effective in high dimensional spaces.\n",

    "    SVM algorithm is not suitable for large data sets.\n",
    "    SVM does not perform very well when the data set has more noise i.e. target classes are overlapping."
